# About Me:
```
            I'm currently focused on the Spring Framework (Boot, MVC, Data, Cloud, Security, Batch), 
            RESTful API design, MongoDB, SQL and Redis databases using Java, Docker containerization and 
            Git version control.

            I'm also researching Artificial Intelligence applications such as Object Detection, Tracking
            and Object Re-Identification using PyTorch, as well as Computer Vision tasks with Python.

            I have some knowledge about Unity 2D and 3D with C#. Go play some in my repository!
