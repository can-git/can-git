# About Me:
```
            I'm currently focused on Deep Learning applications such as Object Detection, Tracking
            and Object Re-Identification using PyTorch, as well as Computer Vision tasks with Python.

            I have some knowledge about Unity 2D and 3D with C#.

            I'm familiar with the Spring Framework (Boot, MVC, Data, Cloud, Security, Batch), 
            RESTful API design, MongoDB and Redis databases using Java, Docker containerization and 
            Git version control.

            Also occasionally using Blender for 3D modeling, as well as Photoshop CS6 for image editing.
